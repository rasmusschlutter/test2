## About the Collection
Hello!

Thanks for stopping by. This collection features works by Rasmus Schlutter, a cultural worker living in Iowa City, Iowa. Rasmus built this site with the help of CollectionBuilder-GH (https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/.

The collection contains nine objects created in and for social movements in Iowa City, IA, New Haven, CT, and Brooklyn, NY. None of these projects were for pay or hire, and instead emerged from social movements themselves.
